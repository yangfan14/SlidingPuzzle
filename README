# The program of the classic game -- sliding puzzle

### General Introduction
Players input their name and set the maximum number of moves they will use, then use the mouse to play. They can slide pieces vertically or horizontally on a board to establish an end result that matches a solution. They can also select to auto-unscramble the pieces, load new puzzles, or quit the game.

### Todo next
